## Built With
* Python
* Discord API
## Getting Started
* Fork it.
* Before you can dive into any Python code to handle events and create exciting automations, you need to create a Discord account and get your token.

* To get your token, go to your [application]("https://discord.com/developers/applications/") > bots tab > copy your token. 

* Refer to this [article](https://realpython.com/how-to-make-a-discord-bot-python/) for detailed instructions


* Refer to .env.sample and create your own .env file by replaceing <Token> with your actual token.

* Clone your forked repo and cd inside it:

```
git clone https://github.com/IEEE-VIT/concy-bot.git && cd concy-bot
```

* Checkout to a new branch to work on an issue (basically telling git to start a new branch via the command line):

```
git checkout -b my-amazing-feature
```

* Run It Locally
```
python3 bot.py
```

* Once you're all done coding, it's time to open a PR :)
Run the following commands from the root of the project directory:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Explain what you have done in a very short way."
git push origin <my-amazing-feature>
```



* Open your forked repo in your browser and then raise a PR to the `master` branch of this repository!

* Read more about raising a PR [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-make-your-first-pull-request-on-github-3/) if you have any doubts
